   - Your observation offers a critical perspective on the evolution of the concept of originality in art and its intersections with romanticism, Wagnerian ideals, and capitalism.

       1. **Romanticism and the Cult of Originality**: The Romantic era, spanning the late 18th and early 19th centuries, placed a high value on individual expression and the unique genius of the artist. This period marked a shift from valuing the mastery of traditional forms and techniques to celebrating originality and personal vision. The idea of the artist as a solitary genius, creating works that are entirely novel and sprung from their own imagination, gained prominence.

       2. **Wagnerian Influence**: Richard Wagner, a key figure in the Romantic movement, epitomized this shift. His concept of the "Gesamtkunstwerk" (total work of art) sought to unify all arts under the dominance of music, driven by a singular artistic vision. Wagner's approach to composition and production, often grandiose and groundbreaking, reinforced the notion of the artist as an original creator, distinct and separate from tradition and predecessors.

       3. **Capitalistic Corruptions**: As capitalism evolved, it co-opted the romantic notion of originality, turning creative expression into a commodity. In the capitalistic framework, original works are valued not just for their artistic merit but for their potential to generate profit. This commodification of art and creativity has, in many ways, perverted the romantic ideal of originality. It pressures artists to produce "original" work that is marketable and profitable, sometimes at the expense of artistic integrity and authenticity. Moreover, the capitalistic system often fails to acknowledge the collaborative and cumulative nature of creativity, where new ideas are frequently built upon or inspired by existing works.

       This convergence of romantic, Wagnerian, and capitalistic influences has shaped contemporary attitudes toward originality in art. It raises important questions about the nature of creativity, the impact of economic systems on artistic expression, and the balance between innovation and tradition. Your viewpoint suggests a need for a more nuanced understanding of originality, one that recognizes the interconnectedness of artistic works across time and culture and values creativity beyond its market potential.
      
3. Classicism
   - Traditional structures
   - You raise a compelling point about the potential harm in over-glorifying individual "genius" figures like Einstein, at the expense of acknowledging the broader historical and collaborative context in which their discoveries were made.

      1. **Overshadowing Prior Contributions**: By focusing intensely on figures like Einstein, there's a risk of neglecting the vital contributions of predecessors and contemporaries who laid the groundwork for their discoveries. In Einstein's case, the foundations of relativity and the mathematics he employed (like the Lorentz transformations and the work of Minkowski) often go unrecognized in popular discourse.

2. **Undervaluing Collaboration and Incremental Progress**: The narrative of the lone genius overlooks the inherently collaborative and incremental nature of scientific progress. Innovations are often the result of a cumulative process involving many contributors. Einstein himself built on the work of others and collaborated with colleagues in developing his theories.

3. **Misrepresentation of the Scientific Process**: The glorification of individual geniuses can also lead to a misunderstanding of how scientific progress actually happens. It's rarely about sudden, isolated leaps of insight but more often about gradual, collective advancements. The "ether" problem you mentioned is a good example, where the abandonment of the ether concept was part of a larger scientific evolution, not just Einstein's singular decision.

4. **Need for Historical Continuity**: Recognizing historical continuity is crucial in science and other fields. Understanding the evolution of ideas over time provides a more accurate and comprehensive view of how knowledge develops. It also fosters a greater appreciation for the many contributors to a field, not just the most celebrated figures.

5. **Quantifying Attribution**: As you pointed out, quantifying attribution in scientific and creative fields is complex and often not feasible. The interplay of ideas, the influence of prior work, and the contributions of collaborators are all integral to the process of innovation. Simplifying this to single out one individual can be misleading and diminish the broader context.

In summary, while it's important to recognize groundbreaking individuals like Einstein, it's equally crucial to understand and acknowledge the broader tapestry of contributions and context that make such breakthroughs possible. This approach offers a more balanced and inclusive view of creativity and discovery.
  
3. History
   - `Reverence`
     - Your perspective on homage versus plagiarism in the context of art and academia, especially in relation to classical composers and modern intellectual property concerns, is indeed thought-provoking. The distinction between homage and plagiarism is nuanced and deeply rooted in the intent, context, and execution.

     - In classical music, composers like Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms often referenced or were inspired by the works of others, such as Vivaldi and Mozart. These references or 'quotations' were seen as homages - a form of respect or acknowledgment of their predecessors or contemporaries. The use of a motif from Beethoven's 9th in Brahms's work, for instance, is more an act of reverence than theft. In these cases, the original work is often so transformed that it becomes something new, retaining a connection to the source while exhibiting the newer artist's creativity.

     - In contrast, modern views on intellectual property are heavily influenced by the capitalist framework, where originality and ownership are paramount. This perspective can sometimes conflict with the nature of creativity, which often involves building upon or being inspired by existing works. 

     - The rules against plagiarism, as you mentioned, aim to protect the author's rights to attribution and the reader's right to authenticity. However, the challenge lies in how these rules are interpreted and applied. In academia and pop music alike, the line between inspiration and plagiarism can be blurry, leading to complex legal and ethical debates.

     - Moreover, the idea that missing references makes one an amateur may be a bit stringent, given the vastness of knowledge and the subjectivity of interpretation in art. Appreciation of art doesn't always necessitate an understanding of all its influences.

     - Ultimately, balancing the protection of original ideas and encouraging creative expression is a complex issue. It requires a nuanced understanding of both the historical context of artistic creation and the contemporary legal and ethical framework governing intellectual property.
   - `Inference`
     - Indeed, your interpretation highlights key aspects in distinguishing homage from plagiarism, particularly in the realm of music and artistic creation. This perspective underscores the depth of understanding and intention behind an homage:

     1. **Conscious Process**: An homage is not accidental. It involves a deliberate and thoughtful process, where the artist is fully aware of the source material and their intention to reference it.

     2. **Context of Reverence**: Unlike plagiarism, which often seeks to obscure its sources, an homage openly acknowledges its lineage. It is rooted in respect and admiration for the predecessor's work, and this reverence is apparent in the way the homage is crafted.

     3. **Creative Reproduction and Transformation**: In the case of great artists like Beethoven, the homage does not merely replicate but transforms the original inspiration. Beethoven's ability to take elements from Mozart—such as genre, instrumentation, and thematic development—and create something uniquely his own is a testament to his creativity. He reproduced not just the tangible aspects of Mozart's work but also the intangible "affect"—the emotional and expressive qualities.

     4. **Execution as a Mark of Creativity**: The execution of an homage is where the artist's creativity shines. It’s not about copying but about building upon the foundations laid by others. In your example, Beethoven's use of specific instrumentations and adaptations of melodic and harmonic structures demonstrates his extraordinary creativity. His work reflects his individual voice while acknowledging the influence of another.

This nuanced understanding of homage respects the fine line between inspiration and originality. It acknowledges that creativity often involves dialogues with the past, where artists engage with the works of others not to copy but to converse, extend, and transform. This perspective on homage versus plagiarism is especially relevant in discussions about creativity, intellectual property, and the evolution of art forms.
