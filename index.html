        <p>Look...; Small enough to care and big enough to celebrate....! A typical cell group fellowship of hitherto retired General Senior Citizens coming together to care and celebrate. 

If you do such a practice for example, once a month for only 1-2 hours or more it will be only 12 times a year at a common venue; and may be only once in every home  in year; But at the same time creating a permanent network of friends and alternative siblings to care and celebrate with regularly.

 Our main pursuit is "Formidable Longer Life Experiences for all age groups. What "Gerontology Excellence does is to inspire and possibly start you off and also build your capacity to sustain. Bleeding from Makerere University, our bleeding grounds of influence are only 3 namely;  legitimate   places of worship, work and community. 

If you are also interested, just "inbox" and be guided too...!</p>
